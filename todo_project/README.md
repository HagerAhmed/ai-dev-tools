## 🤖 Built with ChatGPT

This project was developed through an iterative process using ChatGPT prompts.  
I asked ChatGPT to help me:

- create the Django project structure  
- build models, views, forms, and templates  
- improve the UI with Bootstrap  
- add animations, colors, and better layout  
- debug issues such as migrations, templates, and forms  
- modernize the interface step by step  

Throughout development, I provided ChatGPT with code, error messages, and UI requirements, and refined the app based on the responses.
